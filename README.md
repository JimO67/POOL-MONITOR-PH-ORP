# POOL-MONITOR-PH-ORP

On the cost float multiplier
I powered the Phidgits boards with 5V  but my ADS1115 is powered by 3.3V.  I'm not 100% sure on my math here.  I fudged the 0.60665 factor to get results to match known sample.
My results mirror my chemmical tests well enough;but I wanted to buy three PH solutions to make sure my readings are accurate across the PH range (which is probably not necessary given I want my pool PH in such a tight range around 7.5, who caresa about PH4 or PH 14.
